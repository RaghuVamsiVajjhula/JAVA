 A variable is a place holder for a value that behaves according to the value it consists.
 There are numbers,words,sentences, boolean values and more which we can store in variables.

There are many types of   DATA TYPES.Mostly used types are:
1.integer- takes 4 bytes  -2billion to 2 billion.
 2.boolean  -takes 1 bit    -true or false.
 3.double   -takes 8 bytes  -fractional number upto 15 digits EX:3.123131313...
 4.char      -takes 2 bytes -single character like EX: 'f'
 5.String       -variable size      -sequence of characters.

 Here string is a reference data type
 Remaining are primitive data type.
  
  primitive data types:
  1.  8 types (boolean,byte,etc..)
  2.    stores data
  3.    can hold more than 1 value
  4.    Consists of less memory.
  5.    It is faster.


  reference data types:
1.  unlimited(bcoz they are user defined.)
2.  stores address
3.  can hold more than 1 value
4.  Consists more memory.
5.  It is slower.


Declaration of a variable    ->STEP 1
int x;

Assignment of variable         ->STEP 2
x=100;

Initialisation of variable      ->STEP 3
int x=100;
